abstract: Neural rhythms are ubiquitous in cortical recordings, but it is unclear whether they emerge due to the basic structure of cortical microcircuits, or depend on function. Using detailed electrophysiological and anatomical data of mouse V1, we explored this question by building a spiking network model of a cortical column incorporating pyramidal cells, PV, SST and VIP inhibitory interneurons, and dynamics for AMPA, GABA and NMDA receptors. The resulting model matched in vivo cell-type-specific firing rates for spontaneous and stimulus-evoked conditions in mice, although rhythmic activity was absent. Upon introduction of long-term synaptic plasticity in the form of an STDP rule, broad-band (15-60 Hz) oscillations emerged, with feedforward/feedback input streams enhancing/suppressing the oscillatory drive, respectively. These plasticity-triggered rhythms relied on all cell types, and specific experience-dependent connectivity patterns were required to generate oscillations. Our results suggest that neural rhythms are not necessarily intrinsic properties of cortical circuits, but rather they may arise from structural changes elicited by learning-related mechanisms.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: We present here a computational model of a cortical column circuit, and explore the conditions upon which oscillations may emerge in this system -revealing that synaptic plasticity plays an important role in the process.

abstract: |
  Memory systems with biologically constrained synapses have been the topic of intense theoretical study for over thirty years. Perhaps the most fundamental and far-reaching finding from this work is that the storage of new memories implies the partial erasure of already-stored ones. This overwriting leads to a decorrelation of sensory-driven activity patterns over time, even if the input patterns remain similar. Representational drift (RD) should therefore be an expected and inevitable consequence of ongoing memory storage. We tested this hypothesis by fitting a network model to data from long-term chronic calcium imaging experiments in mouse hippocampus. Synaptic turnover in the model inputs, consistent with the ongoing encoding of new activity patterns, accounted for the observed statistics of RD. This mechanism also provides a parsimonious explanation for the recent finding that RD in CA1 place cells has two distinct components: one which depends only on the passage of time, and another which depends on the time spent exploring a given environment. Furthermore, in the context of ongoing learning, the drift rate of any one memory depends on its repetition rate, a mechanism which can reproduce the diverse effects of experience on drift found in experiment. Our results suggest that RD should be observed wherever neuronal circuits are involved in a process of ongoing learning or memory storage.
