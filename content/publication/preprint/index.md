abstract: "Memory systems with biologically constrained synapses have been the topic of intense theoretical study for over thirty years. Perhaps the most fundamental and far-reaching finding from this work is that the storage of new memories implies the partial erasure of already-stored ones. This overwriting leads to a decorrelation of sensory-driven activity patterns over time, even if the input patterns remain similar. Representational drift (RD) should therefore be an expected and inevitable consequence of ongoing memory storage. We tested this hypothesis by fitting a network model to data from long-term chronic calcium imaging experiments in mouse hippocampus. Synaptic turnover in the model inputs, consistent with the ongoing encoding of new activity patterns, accounted for the observed statistics of RD. This mechanism also provides a parsimonious explanation for the recent finding that RD in CA1 place cells has two distinct components: one which depends only on the passage of time, and another which depends on the time spent exploring a given environment. Furthermore, in the context of ongoing learning, the drift rate of any one memory depends on its repetition rate, a mechanism which can reproduce the diverse effects of experience on drift found in experiment. Our results suggest that RD should be observed wherever neuronal circuits are involved in a process of ongoing learning or memory storage."

abstract: "Despite the traditional view of parietal cortex as an important region for perceptual decision-making, recent evidence suggests that sensory accumulation occurs simultaneously across many cortical regions. We explored this hypothesis by integrating connectivity, cellular and receptor density datasets and building a large-scale macaque brain model able to integrate conflicting sensory signals and perform a decision-making task. Our results reveal sensory evidence accumulation supported by a distributed network of temporal, parietal and frontal regions, with flexible sequential decision pathways which depend on task difficulty. The model replicates experimental lesioning effects and reveals that the causal irrelevance of parietal areas like LIP for decision performance is explained by compensatory mechanisms within a distributed integration process. The model also reproduces observed temporal gating effects of distractor timing during and after the integration process. Overall, our work hints at perceptual integration during decision-making as a broad distributed phenomenon and provides multiple testable predictions."
